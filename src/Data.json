They are more likely since they are more developed and have more cells. When compared to transferring three or four Day 3 embryos, the specialist can reduce the number of embryos to be transferred and exchange only a few blastocysts while still having a high pregnancy rate.",
                        "Additionally, since the expert is only exchanging 1–2 blastocysts, you can freeze the extra blastocysts, giving you the chance to complete multiple cycles in the future. In light of the fact that the overall pregnancy rate is increasing, this makes it more useful.",
                        "The final and most important reason to request a blastocyst transfer is that you won't have to endure the scary 2-week wait during which you won't know whether you will become pregnant or not if you have poor quality embryos. Therefore, if the IVF cycle fails after exchanging Day 3 embryos, it is impossible to determine if the problem was that the foetus did not develop further or whether there was some other reason why the implantation failed. Even more so, you're uncertain as to whether your embryo will live for five days or not.",
                        "This is especially true for older women with fewer eggs. Such women are more likely to experience a failed IVF because their embryos are more likely to halt and not develop into blastocysts. Many of the embryos can be genetically abnormal.",
                        "These are the patients who might benefit most greatly from a blastocyst transfer. However, because they typically have poor ovarian response, the doctor is reluctant to develop the embryos all the way to the blastocyst stage when just 3–4 eggs are collected. The patient will blame them if it doesn't work out. For this reason, they would much rather transfer the embryos back into the uterus, where they could claim  \"implantation failure\" if the cycle did not succeed.",
                        "However, following the embryo swap, the patient is duped into believing that \"Amazingly, possibly this embryo may implant and grow into a baby,\" which is why they are so optimistic during the waiting period.",
                        "This false expectation is hurting. They believe that their uterus rejected the embryo at the time when the cycle ends prematurely, which is when they are persuaded to pursue surrogacy. This is dreadful advise which is absolutely imperfect on the grounds that the issue is with the egg and not with the uterus.",
